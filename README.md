# Analyzing-Customer-reviews-
An intelligent tool for summarizing customer reviews and extracting key insights through sentiment analysis.
I approached this project from two angles:

1.Using LLM prompting.

2.Applying NLTK techniques.

For testing purposes, I used reviews from Amazon, selecting both positive and negative feedback. Interestingly, both approaches offered different perspectives, which can be utilized based on our specific needs.
